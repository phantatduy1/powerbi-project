# Simple Project with PowerBI
06/2022 US Airlines Domestic Departure Report using PowerBI

# Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jl8771/2022-us-airlines-domestic-departure-data <br>
This dataset contains compiled data of US domestic flight take off data, combined with airport data, aircraft data, and present weather data. Inspired by similar datasets for specific airports, older years.

# Data used in this Project
Data of US domestic flight in May and June, 2022. Each record contains flight date, departure hour, operating carrier, origin airport, departure delay, cancel status, cancelled reason, origin state.

## This report will answer:

    1. How many flights are there overall this month?

    2. How are flights distributed by day of week and hour?

    3. What is the average delay time and OTP? For what reason did the most flights get canceled?

    4. For each operator, which airports and states have the most departure flights? 

    
# Approach
Analysed **1.2M rows data** across **18 fields** to determine flight volume , departure delay times, cancellations causes and flight reliability of airlines from  **ETL(Extract, Transform & Load) to Visualization**.

# Outcome
Providing a dashboard allows users to acquire extensive and valuable information about flights in both general and particular airlines. Better ideas for the future can then be suggested.
